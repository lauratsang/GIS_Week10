# GIS Week10
I used a tool in QGIS and ArcGIS to find the shortest path between two points. I thought it was much easier to use the ArcGIS Python tool compared to the QGIS one. The difficulties of the QGIS tool were due to the fact that you need to load individuals packages into the environment before being able to use all the tools. Additionally, I felt that the ArcGIS tools were more easily accessed and you didn't need to ensure they were in the correct filepath. I thought the ArcGIS tutorial was also easier to follow - which says more about the tutorial than the program, but it helps that ESRI is publishing them rather than community members.

For my final project, I have collected all the data and written out which analyses I am planning on doing. I have not had much time to begin the project yet, but I originally had planned to do the project in QGIS. However, when I began loading some of the data into QGIS and downloading some of the toolboxes that I needed, I had some difficulty with finding correct file path. Additionally, some of the data that I have is too large so that the analyses take a long time and are inconvenient. I plan to reduce the study area to one county in Texas and comparing the flood impacts from before and after Hurricane Harvey.
